    16. <u>General Information</u>. OGSystems administers and operates the Portal and the Services from its location in
    Chantilly, Virginia USA. Although the
    Portal may be accessible worldwide, not all features or Services discussed, referenced, provided or offered through
    or
    on the Portal are available to all
    persons or in all geographic locations, or are appropriate or available for use in your jurisdiction. OGSystems
    reserves the right to limit the provision
    and quantity of any feature or Service to any person or geographic area in its sole discretion. Any offer for any
    feature or Service made on the Portal is
    void where prohibited. If you access the Portal from outside of the United States, you do so at your own risk and
    are
    responsible for compliance with the
    laws of the jurisdiction in which you are then-located. These Terms and the Privacy Policy constitute the entire
    agreement between you and OGSystems with
    regard to the relationship between you and OGSystems, supersede any prior agreements between you and OGSystems and
    shall govern all use of the Portal and
    communications therein. These Terms, the Privacy Policy, your use of the Portal and any other agreement with, and
    the
    relationship between, you and
    OGSystems shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia without regard to conflict of law
    provisions.
    You and OGSystems agree to submit to
    the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the pertinent state or federal courts located within or with jurisdiction
    over Fairfax County, Commonwealth of
    Virginia, regardless of the fact that the Portal is accessible outside the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United
    States. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
    OGSystems may seek equitable relief, including preliminary and permanent injunction, in any court of competent
    jurisdiction to prevent or enjoin
    misappropriation, misuse, unauthorized disclosure or infringement of any intellectual property rights. The failure
    of
    OGSystems to exercise or enforce any
    right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of
    these
    Terms is found by a court of
    competent jurisdiction to be invalid, you and OGSystems nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give
    effect to your and OGSystems’ intentions
    as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms shall remain in full force and effect. You
    agree that regardless of any statute or
    law to the contrary, you must file any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to your use of the Portal
    or
    these Terms within six (6) months
    after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. The section titles in these Terms are for
    convenience
    only and have no legal or contractual
    effect. The parties have expressly agreed that English shall be the official language governing these Terms. You
    will
    comply with all applicable export
    laws, restrictions and regulations of any United States or foreign agency or authority and will not export or
    re-export, or allow the export or re-export
    of any product, technology or information you obtain or acquire in connection with the Portal in violation of any
    such
    laws, restrictions or regulations.
    You waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any right you may have to trial by jury in respect of any claim,
    demand, action or cause of action
    arising out of or in connection with these Terms.
