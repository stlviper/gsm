  <p>We at OGSystems, LLC, along with our subsidiaries and affiliates (“OGSystems”), respect your concerns about privacy. This Privacy Policy, which applies to OGSystems’ GEOINT Solutions Marketplace (GSM) website and any associated websites (collectively, the “Portal”), describes the types of personal information we collect on the Portal, how we use the information, with whom we share it and the choices available to you regarding our use of the information. We also describe the measures we take to protect the security of the information and how you can contact us about our privacy practices.</p>

<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
<p>OGSystems provides content access, management and hosting services in connection with the operation of the Portal and the facilitation of communication between Users on the Portal, including, but not limited to, information, products, services and listings provided by Users and third parties and collaboration features used to support discussions between Users in an open forum (collectively, the “Services”). In connection with these Services, OGSystems may request and store information about organizations, products, mission challenges and individuals. All information that you input when accessing and/or using the Portal is subject to collection and storage by OGSystems.</p>

<p>We may collect and store any personal information that you provide when you use the Portal, such as when you create a user account and choose a password, access the Portal or request information, participate in discussions or communicate with other users through the Portal, post information of any kind on the Portal (such as products, challenges, background information or registration information), or contact us through the Portal. This information can include, but is not limited to, (a) your name, email address, postal or other physical address, or other contact information; (b) username, password and other registration information; (c) title, occupation and any other information used to carry out a transaction you have requested; and (d) information you provide us when you contact us. You may provide personal information directly or it may be gleaned through the Portal. For example, when you create a user account and choose a password for security, you are required to provide personal information. The Portal saves your information so that the next time you access your account, you only need to enter your unique ID and password. Personal information also will be shared by users in connection with communications made through the Portal. If you contact us, a record of that session or correspondence will be maintained. We may retain these communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve the Portal and/or the Services. Your contact information is collected and stored when you access the Portal or request information.</p>

<p>We also may automatically collect information regarding your interaction with, and use of, the Portal. OGSystems may use a variety of methods to collect this information, including, but not limited to, cookies, pixel tags, Web beacons, embedded Web links and other commonly used information gathering tools. Through these automated collection methods, we may collect information that your browser or device sends to us, such as your browser type and language, access times, IP address, user-agent string, unique device identifier, browser characteristics (such as browser type and language) and click stream behavior. We also may use Google Analytics or similar analytics services on the Portal to help us analyze how visitors use the Portal. [Our service providers and other parties described in this Privacy Policy with whom we share information may collect information about your online activities, over time and across third-party websites, when accessing the Portal.] You may set your browser either to notify you when you receive a cookie or to refuse to accept cookies. However, if you do so, you may not be able to participate in certain parts of Portal and/or its features. The Portal is not designed to respond to “do not track” signals from browsers.</p>

<p>Information may be collected by us or by our service providers. We may combine information you provide to us with other information from other OGSystems’ sources, transactions and communications. We also may combine that information with data that is publicly available and data from third parties.</p>
